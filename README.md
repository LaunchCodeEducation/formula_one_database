# formula_one_database

## Purpose of Repo

This repo will contain the necessary SQL code and instructions to setup a full database for Data Analysis students to use for SQL practice.

For the current data and relations, I will try to set it up with read-only permissions for non-admin members hitting the DB.

You can modify this code and it's eventual database however you want.

Original data is pulled from this kaggle page:
